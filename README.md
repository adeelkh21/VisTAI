## Overview

VistAI is an end-to-end medical imaging system designed for automated brain tumor classification and segmentation from X-ray scans. The system integrates established deep learning architectures with knowledge distillation (KD) techniques to produce computationally efficient models suitable for real-world and edge-device deployment.

This project does not introduce a novel deep learning framework. Instead, it focuses on the systematic application of knowledge distillation to compress high-capacity teacher models into lightweight student models while preserving diagnostic performance. The resulting models demonstrate reduced inference latency, lower memory footprint, and improved deployability without significant accuracy degradation.
